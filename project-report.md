# Culinary Canvas - Project Progress Report

## 1. Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** The culinary world lacks a dedicated social platform where chefs and cooking enthusiasts can share recipes, follow favorite chefs, and discover new culinary inspirations in an engaging, user-friendly manner.

**Objective:** Create a social cooking platform where users can share recipes, follow chefs, and discover new recipes based on various criteria such as cuisine type, ingredients, and difficulty level.

**Scope:** The project includes user authentication, recipe CRUD operations, chef profiles and following functionality, recipe exploration with advanced filtering, and a responsive UI for all devices.

## 3. DevOps Implementation Details

### 3.1 Version Control & Collaboration
- **Repository Link:** https://github.com/yourusername/culinarycanvas
- **Branching Strategy:** GitFlow - main for production, dev for development, feature branches for new features
- **Pull Requests & Merge Strategy:** All changes go through PR review with at least one approval required. Squash merging is used to keep the history clean.

### 3.2 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- **CI/CD Tool Used:** GitHub Actions
- **Pipeline Workflow:** 
  1. Build: Compile and bundle React application
  2. Test: Run linting and unit tests
  3. Security: SonarQube and OWASP ZAP scans
  4. Deploy: Terraform provisioning and deployment to AWS S3/CloudFront
- **Automated Tests:** ESLint for code quality, Jest for unit tests, and security scanning tools

### 3.3 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Tools Used:** Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Docker for local development
- **Deployment Environment:** AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route53, CloudWatch)
- **Infrastructure Configuration:** Static site hosting with S3, CDN with CloudFront, DNS with Route53, and monitoring with CloudWatch

### 3.4 Monitoring & Logging
- **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for dashboards
- **Logging Setup:** Centralized logging with ELK stack, structured logging format, error tracking and alerting

### 3.5 Security & DevSecOps
- **Security Tools Used:** SonarQube for code quality, OWASP ZAP for vulnerability testing, Trivy for container scanning
- **Compliance Checks:** HTTPS enforcement, secure authentication flow, regular dependency updates

## 4. Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge Faced | Solution Implemented |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Chef visibility issues (users not seeing themselves in chef list) | Enhanced user detection logic with fallback mechanisms and profile validation checks |
| Performance issues with recipe filtering | Implemented SQL functions for optimized database queries and client-side caching to reduce API calls |
| Authentication edge cases | Rebuilt authentication flow with timeout protection and better error handling |
| Filter functionality not responding | Fixed click handling in FilterPopover component and updated state management |

## 5. Next Steps & Pending Tasks
1. Implement recommendation engine – Expected Completion: 30/11/2023
2. Complete advanced search features – Expected Completion: 15/11/2023
3. Implement notification system – Expected Completion: 10/12/2023
4. Perform penetration testing – Expected Completion: 05/12/2023
5. Add user behavior analytics – Expected Completion: 20/12/2023

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

**Key Takeaways:**
- DevOps integration from the beginning significantly improved deployment reliability
- Monitoring helped identify performance bottlenecks early
- Security scanning tools caught several potential vulnerabilities before production

**Improvements Needed:**
- More comprehensive testing across different devices
