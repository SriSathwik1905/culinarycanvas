# Culinary Canvas - Project Progress Report

## 1. Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** The culinary world lacks a dedicated social platform where chefs and cooking enthusiasts can share recipes, follow favorite chefs, and discover new culinary inspirations in an engaging, user-friendly manner.

**Objective:** Create a social cooking platform where users can share recipes, follow chefs, and discover new recipes based on various criteria such as cuisine type, ingredients, and difficulty level.

**Scope:** The project includes user authentication, recipe CRUD operations, chef profiles and following functionality, recipe exploration with advanced filtering, and a responsive UI for all devices.

## 3. DevOps Implementation Details

### 3.1 Version Control & Collaboration
- **Repository Link:** https://github.com/SriSathwik1905/culinarycanvas
- **Branching Strategy:** GitFlow - main for production, feature branches for new features and bug fixes
- **Pull Requests & Merge Strategy:** All changes go through PR review with at least one approval required. Squash merging is used to keep the history clean.

### 3.2 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- **CI/CD Tool Used:** GitHub Actions
- **Pipeline Workflow:** 
  1. Build: Compile and bundle React application
  2. Test: Run linting and unit tests
  3. Deploy: Automated deployment to hosting environment
- **Automated Tests:** ESLint for code quality, component testing for UI validation

### 3.3 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Tools Used:** Configuration files for infrastructure setup
- **Deployment Environment:** Supabase for backend (authentication, database), Vercel for frontend hosting
- **Infrastructure Configuration:** Serverless architecture with PostgreSQL database and real-time subscriptions

### 3.4 Monitoring & Logging
- **Monitoring Tools:** Custom application logging, Supabase monitoring
- **Logging Setup:** Structured logging with severity levels and context indicators, client-side error tracking

### 3.5 Security & DevSecOps
- **Security Tools Used:** Automated dependency scanning, secure authentication patterns
- **Compliance Checks:** HTTPS enforcement, secure authentication flow, regular dependency updates

## 4. Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge Faced | Solution Implemented |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Chef visibility issues (users not seeing themselves in chef list) | Enhanced user detection logic with fallback mechanisms and profile validation checks |
| Infinite reload cycle in Chefs page | Added state tracking and initialization flags to prevent redundant data fetching and API calls |
| Authentication timeout issues | Improved Supabase client configuration with extended timeouts and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff |
| Missing database function causing UI issues | Created SQL migration for the missing function and implemented graceful fallback query approach |
| Performance issues with recipe filtering | Implemented SQL functions for optimized database queries and client-side caching to reduce API calls |
| Filter functionality not responding | Fixed click handling in FilterPopover component and updated state management |

## 5. Recent Improvements
1. **Fixed Authentication Reliability**
   - Added timeout configuration to Supabase client (30 seconds)
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API calls
   - Enhanced error handling with proper fallbacks

2. **Resolved Infinite Reload Issues**
   - Added state tracking flags to prevent duplicate data fetching
   - Implemented initialization detection to avoid redundant API calls
   - Created better fallback mechanisms when database functions are unavailable

3. **Enhanced Database Functions**
   - Created SQL migration file for the `get_chefs_with_recipe_counts` function
   - Documented database function requirements and installation steps
   - Implemented direct query fallbacks when RPC functions aren't available

## 6. Next Steps & Pending Tasks
1. Install database functions on Supabase – Expected Completion: 20/04/2023
2. Implement recommendation engine – Expected Completion: 30/05/2023
3. Complete advanced search features – Expected Completion: 15/05/2023
4. Implement notification system – Expected Completion: 10/06/2023
5. Perform security audit – Expected Completion: 05/06/2023

## 7. Conclusion & Learnings

**Key Takeaways:**
- Proper state management is crucial for preventing infinite loops and unnecessary API calls
- Adding retry logic with exponential backoff greatly improves application reliability
- Implementing fallback mechanisms ensures the application works even when unexpected errors occur

**Improvements Needed:**
- More comprehensive testing across different devices and network conditions
- Better error handling for edge cases and offline scenarios
- Implementing proper database migrations process
